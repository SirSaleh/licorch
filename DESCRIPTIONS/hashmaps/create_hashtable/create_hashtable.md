# Hashtable

__In computing, a hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array, also called a dictionary or simply map, which is an abstract data type that maps keys to values.__


## Implemnetation

The base idea is to create a key-valued datastructure, which keys are ordinal numbers. **To create the ordinal numbers**, you can make a calcualte mod of a hash of the keys.
