# Greedy Algorithms

Accouring to [CRLS](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844):


    A greedy algorithm always makes the choice that looks best at
    the moment. That is, it makes a locally optimal choice in the hope that this choice
    will lead to a globally optimal solution. 


In this directory we store problems which can be solved using greedy algorithms.
